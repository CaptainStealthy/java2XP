## What is it?
java<b>2</b>XP is a set of Java bindings for the X-Plane XPLM SDK, amounting to a more reliable interface between Java and X-Plane than was possible with UDP. It's used in the <b>787</b>: Aviator's Edition project from v1.3.0 onwards as a replacement to the unreliable UDP used before.
